Flower Classification using Deep Learning and MobileNetV2
Project Report
1. Introduction
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for classifying images of flowers into different categories using a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model. The project integrates the model with a user-friendly interface using Streamlit, enabling users to upload flower images and get real-time predictions of the flower type. The dataset used contains five different types of flowers: daisy, dandelion, roses, sunflowers, and tulips.

2. Problem Statement
Given an image of a flower, the task is to classify it into one of the predefined categories. A robust model should accurately predict the flower type based on visual features, even when images have variations in lighting, angles, and backgrounds.

3. Objectives
To build a flower classification model using the MobileNetV2 architecture, which is known for its efficiency and high performance in image classification tasks.
To provide real-time predictions via an interactive web interface using Streamlit, where users can upload an image of a flower and receive a classification result with a confidence score.
4. Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Deep Learning Library: TensorFlow and Keras
Pre-trained Model: MobileNetV2
Frontend Interface: Streamlit
Image Processing: PIL (Python Imaging Library)
Dataset: TensorFlow Flower Photos dataset (5 categories: daisy, dandelion, roses, sunflowers, and tulips)
5. Dataset
The dataset is publicly available and consists of five different flower types:

Daisy
Dandelion
Roses
Sunflowers
Tulips
The dataset contains hundreds of images for each category, and it is automatically downloaded from the internet using TensorFlow utilities. It is split into training and validation sets with an 80/20 split.

6. Model Architecture
We used MobileNetV2, a lightweight and efficient convolutional neural network architecture. MobileNetV2 is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, which helps in leveraging transfer learning to improve model performance.

Key Aspects of the Architecture:
Input Shape: 180x180x3 (RGB images of 180x180 pixels)
Base Model: Pre-trained MobileNetV2 with weights from ImageNet
Fine-tuning: The base model is frozen, and we add new layers on top for the flower classification task.
Added Layers:
GlobalAveragePooling2D: Reduces the dimensionality of the feature maps from MobileNetV2.
Dense (128 units): A fully connected layer with ReLU activation to introduce non-linearity.
Dense (Output layer): A softmax layer with 5 units (one for each flower class) to provide class probabilities.
The model was trained using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy as the loss function, which is well-suited for multi-class classification.

7. Model Training
The model was trained on the TensorFlow Flower Photos dataset. The training process consisted of:

Batch Size: 32
Image Size: 180x180 pixels
Number of Epochs: 5
The model training involved:

Loading the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model as the base model.
Adding custom classification layers on top of the base model.
Freezing the base model to retain the features learned from ImageNet.
Training the custom layers for flower classification using the training dataset.
Validation was performed on a separate validation set to ensure the model's generalization capabilities.
8. Evaluation Metrics
The model was evaluated using accuracy as the main metric:

Training Accuracy: ~97% (After 5 epochs)
Validation Accuracy: ~95%
These values indicate that the model generalizes well on unseen data.

9. Real-Time Predictions with Streamlit
To provide a real-time prediction system, Streamlit was used to create an interactive web application where users can upload flower images and get immediate feedback on the flower type and confidence score.

Features of the Web App:
Image Upload: Users can upload flower images in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format.
Image Display: The app displays the uploaded image.
Classification Results: The predicted flower type is shown with a confidence score.
This interaction is powered by the trained MobileNetV2 model, which processes the uploaded image, predicts the class, and returns the result to the user.
